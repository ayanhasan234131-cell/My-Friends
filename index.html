        Abhinav is my online friend and one of the coolest people I know. 
        Even though we haven’t met in real life yet, I really hope we can meet someday. 
        He’s always fun to talk to and makes things more interesting just by being there.

        Arjan is my school friend and a big movie fan. 
        He loves watching movies and recently started watching Stranger Things because I suggested it. 
        He’s really fun to talk to about shows and movies.
